            <p>The Apostle Islands are a collection of 22 islands in Lake Superior located in the northern region of Wisconsin, USA. Originally inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people, the islands contain over hundreds of years worth of rich Native American history. In 1970, 21 of the islands and the surrounding waters were designated as the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, a protected area managed by the National Park Service. Lastly, the islands are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including, white-tailed deer, black bears and various bird species.</p>
            <p>There are six lighthouses spread across the islands, making it one of the largest collections of lighthouses in the United States. When the island receives visitors it is viewed as a popular destination for outdoor activities such as kayaking, sailing, hiking and camping. In addition, many people enjoy other activities such as berry picking. Camping is also allowed in 19 of the 21 islands to date.</p>

            <p>The national capital of Italy remains a historical and political hub today. Nicknamed the “Eternal City,” Rome is considered the origination of the Catholic Church and Roman civilization central to the development of the Western World. Divided into 22 walled rioni (districts) surrounded by 35 quartieri urbani (urban sectors) that are surrounded by 6 large suburbi (suburbs), the city, just larger than New York City at an area of 496 mi2,  is home to 2.8 million residents. Its economy runs on the tourism and services industries, the latter mostly in government jobs.</p>
            <p>The Via del Corso, named after Roman carnival horse races, is the main street that runs through Rome. Many significant churches, palaces, and squares run along this road (Piazza del Popolo, and the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna, for example). The seven hills that surround Rome are trenched with mythological history which can be seen through the prevalence of temples. Must see landmarks for those traveling include the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and Catacombs. St. Peter’s Square & Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, technically located within Vatican City – an independent city-state within Rome – are also worth a visit.</p>
